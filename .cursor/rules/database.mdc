## Database Rules

> *"A database is only as good as the schema that defines it and the queries that use it."*

### Data Modeling

- Follow database normalization principles to reduce redundancy
- Use appropriate data types for columns to optimize storage
- Define clear primary keys for all tables
- Implement foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity
- Create indexes for frequently queried columns
- Use descriptive, consistent naming conventions for tables and columns
- Document table relationships in schema diagrams

### Query Optimization

- Optimize queries to minimize database load
- Use EXPLAIN/query plans to analyze query performance
- Avoid N+1 query problems in ORM implementations
- Limit result sets to necessary data only
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Write efficient JOINs (avoid unnecessary table scans)
- Consider denormalization only when performance benefits outweigh consistency risks

### Migration Strategy

- Use database migrations for all schema changes
- Version all migrations sequentially
- Make migrations idempotent when possible
- Include both up and down migration paths
- Test migrations on copies of production data before deployment
- Document breaking changes in migrations
- Back up data before running migrations in production

### Transaction Management

- Use transactions for operations affecting multiple records
- Keep transactions as short as possible
- Handle transaction rollbacks gracefully
- Be aware of isolation levels and their implications
- Avoid long-running transactions that could lock tables
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Consider distributed transaction patterns for microservices

### Data Integrity & Security

- Never store sensitive data in plain text
- Implement row-level security where appropriate
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper access control at the database level
- Regularly backup and test database restore procedures
- Implement monitoring for unusual query patterns
- Use database connection pooling efficiently
